Here I import a  dataset from sklearn

Dataset Description:
The dataset contains a total of 20,640 samples.
Each sample represents a specific location in California.
There are 8 features (input variables) and 1 target variable (output variable).
The features include:
MedInc: Median income in the block.
HouseAge: Median age of houses in the block.
AveRooms: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms per dwelling.
Population: Block population.
AveOccup: Average number of occupants per dwelling.
Latitude: Latitude of the location.
Longitude: Longitude of the location.
The target variable is:
MedHouseVal: Median house value in the block (the target to be predicted).

I applied multiple linear regression model. 
A multiple linear regression score of 0.5968727041503444 indicates that my model explains approximately 59.69% of the 
variability in the dependent variable using the given independent variables. 
This score is typically represented by the coefficient of determination, also known as R-squared.

R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates that the model perfectly predicts the dependent variable
based on the independent variables, and a value of 0 suggests that the model does not explain any of the variability.
In my case, a score of 0.5968727041503444 indicates a moderate level of performance, 
as more than half of the variability in the dependent variable is captured by the independent variables.
